// Problem Statement :
/*
Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more
than once in the given array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
a[] = {0,3,1,2}
Output: -1
Explanation: N=4 and all elements from 0
to (N-1 = 3) are present in the given
array. Therefore output is -1.

/*
// Time Complexity : O(n);
// Space Complexity : O(1);


Approach: The basic idea is to use a HashMap to solve the problem. But there is a catch, the numbers in the array are
from 0 to n-1, and the input array has length n. So, the input array can be used as a HashMap. While traversing the
array, if an element a is encountered then increase the value of a%n'th element by n. The frequency can be retrieved by
dividing the a%n'th element by n.

Algorithm:

1-->Traverse the given array from start to end.
2-->For every element in the array increment the arr[i]%n'th element by n.
3-->Now traverse the array again and print all those indices i for which arr[i]/n is greater than 1. Which guarantees
that the number n has been added to that index.

Note: This approach works because all elements are in the range from 0 to n-1 and arr[i]/n would be greater than 1 only
if a value "i" has appeared more than once.
